This is a fork of Budabot version 2.2_GA
that was used as a core for building Warbot and Taratime bots for RK2 in 2010-2011.

I have decided to publish all the code as is so maybe somebody could make use of it
and all the work doesn't go to waste.

If you decide to fully use this source I would encourage you to PR your changes back to this fork.

Installation:

The bot is designed to run with 3 (+1) characters:
Twinkbot - bot for low level tower pvp
Warbot - bot for high level tower pvp 201+
Warleaders - bot for faction leaders
Playerbase - temporary bot for updating roster
(people of rubika was blocking warbot for multiple massive queries from same IP)

Create these characters as well as config files for them as follows:
warbot_config.php
twinkbot_config.php
warleaders_config.php
playerbase_config.php
Characters must be in an org and have at least 3rd rank to see tower messages

Note: character names *may* be hardcoded in some of the source files.
Make sure you fix it before you try to run the full operation.

Running:

- Not guaranteed to run on any PHP above version 5.5
- Requires screen application installed for full automation
- Set up cron script to run Warbot.sh every 1 minute to ensure automatic restart
