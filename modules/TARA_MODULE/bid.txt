<header>:::: Help on bidding ::::<end>

To bid: <highlight>/tell taratime bid &lt;number of points&gt;<end>
or to bid all you have: <highlight>/tell taratime bid all<end>

To withdraw your bid: <highlight>/tell taratime unbid<end>

To check your points: <highlight>/tell taratime !points<end>

You can make a bid of 0 points.

Unlike on some other bots, there is no 'cost to bid'.

If you win, you will pay the value of the highest LOSING bid.  (This is called a Vickrey auction.)

If you are the only bidder, you will automatically get the item for 0 points.

Make sure you are bidding on the right item.  There are NO REFUNDS if you change your mind after winning!
