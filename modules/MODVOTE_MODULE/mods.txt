<header>:: Modvote: Vote for Taratime/Warbot Moderators (each 8 weeks) ::<end>

Every WC org will have an option to add 1 member as moderator to each bot:
- warbot (will add to twinkbot too, those share the DB and banlist)
- taratime

<highlight>:: How does it work:<end>
Vote is open for 3 days once in 8 weeks.
5 moderators get selected for each bot with a passing score over 50% and requiring at least 6 different orgs to have voted.
Old votes don't accumulate. Old moderators get removed.
So basically we all have to refresh our votes each voting season (8 weeks) even if we like old mods.
Every org has 100 vote points maximum shared between members (so doesn't matter how many people the org has active in WC).

<highlight>:: How to use:<end>
If voting is open 'Votes for bot Moderators' link pops every 30 minutes in WC bot (Warleaders) and whenever you join private group. Use !modvote command to bring it up.
Anyone from applying org can add a member of this org to the vote by using !mod command (!mod 'bot' 'newmod', ex. !mod taratime Xploit).
When you submit a moderator it doesn't have to be same person for the two bots.
Org leader has a priority to set moderator for org (i.e. anyone can assign an org member for moderator position, but after that only the sponsor or leader can edit the entrant)
If you remove/change entrant, votes are cleared.
